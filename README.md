11t is an iOS and Android app for connecting to [Mastodon](https://github.com/tootsuite/mastodon), written in FuseTools. In beta for both Android and iOS.

I connect to Mastodon on [mastodon.social](https://mastodon.social/), but everyone can start their own server. 11t lets you use any Mastodon instance.

## Android ##
The app is [in the Play Store](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.jeroensmeets.mastodon) and minor versions (as in major.minor.build) are [on F-Droid](https://apt.izzysoft.de/fdroid/index/apk/com.jeroensmeets.mastodon).

## iOS ##
Not yet available.

Version 1.1 was rejected by Apple, they sent me a couple of suggestions I could add to get it accepted. Working on these at the moment.

### How do I pronounce 11t? ###

Easy -- it's `elephan-t`.

### Build it yourself ###

You need the brilliant [FuseTools](https://www.fusetools.com/) and the code in this repository.

### Compliments ###

Font: [Noto](https://www.google.com/get/noto/).

Drawing of blue elephant: [Tineke Meirink](https://www.tinekemeirink.nl/).
