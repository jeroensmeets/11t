# README #

11t is an iOS and Android app for connecting to [Mastodon](https://github.com/tootsuite/mastodon), written in FuseTools. In beta for both Android and iOS.

I connect to Mastodon on [mastodon.social](https://mastodon.social/), but everyone can start her own server. 11t lets you use any Mastodon instance.

### I hear there's a beta test? ###

You are absolutely right! I'm building this app from scratch, so please have some patience.

## iOS ##
Signups for iOS are closed for now. Please hang on, the first public version is right around the corner.

## Android ##
For Android, you can [visit this link](https://play.google.com/apps/testing/com.jeroensmeets.mastodon) on your mobile.

### How do I pronounce 11t? ###

Easy -- it's `elephan-t`.

### Build it yourself ###

You need the brilliant [FuseTools](https://www.fusetools.com/) and the code in this repository.

### Compliments ###

Font: [Noto](https://www.google.com/get/noto/).
